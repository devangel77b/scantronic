# scantronic
Low budget scantron-like command line tool

The goal for this is we scan a stack of MCQ answer sheets and wish to grade
them all at once by running the command line tool on the PDF, and have it
pop out a csv or text output to screen that can then be paste into a grade
spreadsheet, Google Classroom, or the district Genesis app. 

## Benchmarking/similar apps
There are many tools for grading scantron-like tests including zipgrade. However, zipgrade costs money so developing a free and fully open-source zipgrade alternative will help increase access to an extremely useful teaching tool.

Alternatives include:
  * GradeCam by Gradient (Not open source; Reddit is saying a lot about it but can't find original version; Probably rebranded and are now charing money)
  * ZipGrade - $7/year (Which honestly is not that bad -- Yes I thought it was more; like the plaigiarism detection software price is ridiculous 300/yr but 7$ isn't so bad)
  * FormScanner - https://github.com/ylemkimon/formscanner (Looks promising however was last active 9 years ago)
  * Open-MCR - https://github.com/iansan5653/open-mcr (Looks the most promising; Would need work to integrate with different bubble-sheets(currently only 75 and 150 mcq); Relatively active github)
  * Fully custom

I suggest that we further look into Open-MCR and see if that can be used for our purposes. It will likely need to be tweaked further.
